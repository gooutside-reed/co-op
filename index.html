We are in the process of inventorying all our items, so please come in with a list of what you need and don't rely on the website to keep track of what you want to check out. !! We are a free gear rental service for Reed College Students, Staff and Faculty! This website contains a live inventory of all of the gear that we have available to rent. This website is designed to be used either in-person at the Co-Op or to online pre-order gear. Come in any time during our open hours to use us as a resource for trip planning, what to bring for a camping trip, or anything else outdoor-related!</h4>
